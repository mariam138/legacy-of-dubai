        <p class="paragraph">
          The earliest mention of Dubai was recorded in 1095 in <strong>The Book of Geography</strong>, written by the Andalusian-Arab geographer <em>Abu Abdullah Al
          Bakri.</em> But more recent mentions start in 1580 from the
          Venetian pearl merchant <em>Gaspero Balbi</em>. Balbi recorded the city of
          Dubai when he visited for their pearl trade. At the time, Dubai
          was a simple port city and relied solely on fishing, boat-building
          and the pearl trade to fund peoples livelihood. Dubai also relied on
          building accommodation for traders who would pass through to sell
          gold, textiles and spices at the markets.

        <h3 class="section-header">1750's - 1949: The Pearling Industry</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In the 1750s, pearling became the main industry of the Gulf, including
          Dubai, and this continued well into the twentieth century despite it
          being a seasonal trade. The pearling season, known in Arabic as <em>Ghaus
          al-Kabir</em> (the great dive), lasted between May and September of each
          year. Men from around the Gulf and further afield would gather at the
          Gulf ports (Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Ras al-Khaimah in particular), ready
          for a three and a half month expedition. Fleets of up to 1200 boats
          would set sail on these expeditions from the ports. It was even
          recorded in <em>Lorimer’s Gazetteer</em> that 22,000 men (accounting for more
          than 50% the population of the then Trucial States) were employed for
          pearling season by the 1900s. The success of the pearling industry was
          mainly due to the rise in demand for pearls in the West, combined with
          their rising interest in the Orient. The pearling industry transformed
          Dubai into one of the leading ports in the Gulf.

        <p class="paragraph">
          Despite the fluctuation of pearl pricings throughout the time of the
          pearling industry, success was still booming. But this all came to a
          crashing halt by the 1930s, when the creation of the artificial pearl started
          to take off in Japan. Although the technique for creating (not very
          rounded) artificial pearls can be traced back to thirteenth
          century China, the first batch of <strong>rounded</strong> artificial pearls
          was made in 1900 in Australia, by a man called <em>William Saville-Kent</em>.
          Two Japanese men, <em>Tatsuhei Mise</em> and <em>Tokishi Nishikawa</em>, learned of this
          technique from the Australian and brought it back to Japan. However,
          the start of the artificial pearl business didn’t truly pick up until
          a man called <em>Kokichi Mikimoto</em>, born in Japan in 1858, started to
          conduct his own experiments on making artificial pearls after being in
          the pearl-selling business during his twenties. He would remain
          unsuccessful for five years until he learned of the technique that
          <em>Tatsuhei and Tokishi</em> had brought back from Australia. His own pearls,
          coined the <strong>“Mikimoto Pearls”</strong>, became a huge success in the European
          markets, selling at 25% less than the price of natural pearls. So by the
          1930s, the artificial pearls were now matching - and exceeding - the
          Gulf’s natural pearls in both price and quality (to the untrained
          eye).
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          This was a disaster for the Gulf pearling industry. By 1927, pearling
          merchants began struggling with high interest and borrowing rates. The
          Great Depression in 1929 further reduced demand for natural pearls and by
          1931, the price of natural pearls had dropped by <strong>75%</strong> in just two
          years. The final blow on the industry came in the form of tax imports
          from the Indian government on pearl imports from the Gulf. The very last
          pearling fleet set out from Dubai in 1949.

          1778 - 1853: Bani Yas, Al Qassimi and the Trucial States
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          It is hard to talk about the history of Dubai without also mentioning
          Abu Dhabi, Dubai's neighbouring emirate and the founding <em>Bani Yas</em> tribe. Originally, the Bani Yas
          tribe came from Abu Dhabi. There is a legend that surrounds the name of
          Bani Yas. A leader (or more commonly, <strong>sheikh</strong>), called <em>Yas</em>, dug the first well in the oasis in Abu
          Dhabi, led by a Gazelle (this is where the name Abu Dhabi comes from -
          Father of the Gazelle) and several tribes congregated around this
          well, leading to the name Bani Yas. However, it is more likely that
          the name derived from a man called <em>Yas Bin Amer</em>, who was a tribal
          leader with a lineage that dates far back.</p> 
          
          <p class="paragraph">The Bani Yas tribe are a
          big part in the formation of Dubai as we know it today. Abu Dhabi and
          Dubai used to be at war in the past over their
          borders. In 1833, <em>Maktoum bin Butti</em> of the Bani Yas
          tribe decided to settle in the Dubai Creek and declare independence
          of Dubai from Abu Dhabi. From then on, Dubai was declared a fishing
          village (alongside being a pearling port). This was the start of
          putting Dubai on the map, figuratively, and also the start of the ruling Maktoum family of Dubai.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          There was another tribe called the <em>Al Qassimi</em> tribe, among several other
          tribes that existed before the founding of the UAE. Dating back from
          before the independence of Dubai from Abu Dhabi, Al Qassimi were
          responsible for several maritime skirmishes with the British, starting
          in 1778. This led to great instability along the Gulf coast on the
          Arabian side. After several years of maritime wars between the British
          and the tribes, including both <em>Al Qassimi</em> and <em>Bani Yas</em>>, the British
          finally won in 1819 and began to destroy any buildings that were
          Qassimi owned, flying the British flag. Because of their win,
          sheikhs of several tribes started to surrender to the British.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In January 1820, over a period of 10 days, Sheikhs from the tribes
          began to sign peace treaties with the British. This involved giving up
          their strongholds, guns and vessels in exchange for the British
          sparing their towns, or then known <em>sheikhdoms</em>. The first six
          Sheikhdoms <strong>(Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ras al Khaimah, Sharjah, Ajman and Umm
          al Quwain)</strong>, after signing the <strong>General Maritime Treaty of 1820</strong>, formed
          what was known then as the <strong>Trucial States</strong> (with Fujairah to join in
          1952). This is what would be the start of the modern day United Arab
          Emirates.

                    7-pointed
                    star in the middle to represent the seven states (now emirates). The
                    Trucial States were to remain British protectorates until their
                    independence in 1971.

        <p class="paragraph">
          The maritime warfare didn’t stop there. Attacks on
          British ships by the Bani Yas tribe in 1835 then led to a maritime
          truce, banning any maritime warfare during the Gulf coast’s pearling
          season. This then finally led to a permanent maritime warfare ban in
          1853, in return for British protection. This made the Trucial States
          <strong>British protectorates</strong>. The Sheikhs were presented with a final
          <strong>General Treaty of Peace</strong> which would stop piracy along the Gulf
          coast, and all of the Trucial states had to fly a red flag with a
          white border. OVer time, each state had developed their own version of the
          flag to fly.

        <h3 class="section-header">1909-1966: The Discovery of Oil</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          By keeping on good terms with the British, the sheikhdom of Dubai
          continued to survive and thrive under the <strong>Al Maktoum dynasty</strong>, which is
          still the leading dynasty today. After the end of the pearling
          industry, Dubai became a business port instead. As the pearling
          industry was on its final leg, many oil companies were set up and had bought
          concessions to start exploring the Gulf banks for oil. This is despite the fact that
          originally, they had been told that there were no prospects of finding
          any. Still, with a small bit of hope, the searching began.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Starting in the early 1930’s, the exploration of oil was put on hold
          due to the start of World War II, and continued to be delayed even
          after the end of the war in 1945. Searches for oil in Dubai (and Abu
          Dhabi) didn’t start up again until 1953, when the company
          <strong>Anglo-Iranian</strong> (soon to be known as <strong>British Petroleum</strong>) instructed their
          subsidiary, the <strong>D’Arcy Exploration Company</strong>, to apply for a concession
          to search for oil off the coast of Abu Dhabi. This concession was
          granted on the 9th March 1953.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Prospects were looking bleak until 1966 when finally, oil was struck
          in the <em>Fateh</em> (meaning Good Fortune in english) oil field, 75 miles /
          120 km east off the coast of Dubai. By the 1970’s, three twenty-story
          submarine tanks had been built in the seabed, carrying these oil
          reserves, and were given the name <strong>“The Three Pyramids of Dubai”</strong>. After
          the discovery of oil, the late <em>Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum</em>
          began the development of Dubai, transforming it into the modern port
          city it is today.
