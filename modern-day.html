            <p class="paragraph">More oil fields were discovered even after the first one in Fateh: southwest Fateh in 1970, and both Rashid and Falah in
            1976. Although Abu Dhabi was more prosperous in their oil findings (Dubai only had one-twentieth of what Abu Dhabi had),
            Dubai still managed to use the money from the oil to fund several projects for the Gulf to build it into the modern day
            emirate as we know.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Up until this point, Dubai and the other Trucial States were still British protectorates. But it started to become too
            expensive to keep British troops abroad in Dubai due to the devaluation of the pound. Harold Wilson, prime minister of
            the United Kingdom between 1964-1970, announced that Britain would therefore withdraw all its armed forces from the
            Gulf. Roy Jenkins, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1967 and 1970, put forward a proposal that stated
            Britain would withdraw its armed forces by 1st April 1971. With no British ruling of the Trucial States, this would
            start the formation of the United Arab Emirates.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">After several years of war with each other, Sheikh Zayed (ruler of Abu Dhabi) and Sheikh Rashid (ruler of Dubai) made a
            truce to come together to start the formation of the United Arab Emirates. Meetings of the then 9 nations to form the
            UAE (including Bahrain and Kuwait, who would later choose independence) began in Dubai, later to be known as the Dubai
            Meeting. As Abu Dhabi then generated 80% of the Trucial States’ income, it was clear that Sheikh Zayed would become
            president of the federation, making Abu Dhabi the capital of the UAE. This would confirm Sheikh Zayed’s leadership.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Several meetings later, on 18th July 1971, Sheikh Zayed officially announced the formation of the United Arab Emirates,
            which then comprised 6 of the 7 Trucial States - with Ras al Khaimah to later join the UAE on 10th February 1972,
            forming the 7 emirates. On 1st December 1971, the existing treaties between the Trucial States and Great Britain were
            revoked, ending the ruling of Great Britain. The next day, on 2nd December 1971, the (then six) rulers signed the
            provisional constitution and elected Sheikh Zayed as president of the UAE, and Sheikh Rashid vice president. The United
            Arab Emirates had finally gained their independence, and is celebrated every year on the 2nd December as National day
            (Al Yawm Al Watani in Arabic). 2021 saw the United Arab Emirates celebrate its 50th year of independence.</p>

            <h3 class="section-header">1971 - Today: The evolution of Dubai</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The discovery of oil led to the investment in the construction of public infrastructure in Dubai. Roads were built,
            schools, hospitals. Sheikh Zayed road (E11) was proposed to Sheikh Zayed, and in 1971 the project was approved and
            construction began. Sheikh Zayed road was finished in 1980, and serves as the longest motorway in the UAE, and serves as
            a link between Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Knowing that the oil reserves were limited, Sheikh Rashid of Dubai began to invest in the development of Dubai’s economy
            and tourism. In 1985, the Emirates airline was established to help further reinvent Dubai as a tourist hub. Since then,
            several projects have been built and completed, adding to the skyline of Dubai today.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">After the death of Sheikh Rashid in 2006, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (shorthand: Sheikh Maktoum) became the
            new ruler of Dubai and vice president of the UAE. Sheikh Maktoum had been planning for the day that Dubai ran out of
            oil, promoting Dubai as a financial and trading hub for the Middle East. The Al Maktoum philosophy of “build and they
            will come”, first started with the late Sheikh Rashid, was carried forward by Sheikh Maktoum and his older brother,
            Sheikh Mohammed. Sheikh Mohammed continued this rapid building and expansion of Dubai, with his reign seeing a campaign
            in global investment.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">In 1999, the Burj al Arab hotel was established, becoming one of the tallest hotels in the world, and being the only
            7-star hotel in the world. In 2008, the Atlantis hotel, the Palm hotel and the Resort launched, followed by the opening
            of Dubai Mall in 2009, still the world’s largest mall to date. In 2010, the Burj Khalifa was opened, becoming the
            world’s tallest building. In 2013, Dubai won the bid to host the World Expo 2020, building what is now known as Dubai
            Expo City. Although delayed due to the pandemic, the Expo was pushed back and held between 1st October 2021 and 31st
            March 2022.</p>
