# Legacy of Dubai: From Sands to Skyscrapers
## Introduction
**Legacy of Dubai** is a website which goes into depth on the history of Dubai, from its beginnings as a Dessert emirate into the luxurious, glamorous City we know of today. The site is targetted towards people who want to learn more about Dubai and its rich history, especially those who are planning to visit Dubai or have already done so. **Legacy of Dubai** will be a useful site for tourists and non-tourists alike who take great interest in Middle Eastern history and culture.

## Design
### Fonts

The header fonts have been set to **Montserrat** for a clean but slightly regal look. As it is a part of the sans serif family, it also allows accessibility for those with visual impairments. I used [fontjoy.com](fontjoy.com) to help pair a similar font to **Montserrat** to be used for the body of the text. The font that was generated was **Mukta**, keeping the theme cohesive, but allowing the pages to still be clean and readable.

### Colour Scheme

I wanted the colour scheme of the website to reflect the colours of the desert, as it is what I most commonly associate Dubai and the Middle East with. I first went onto use [Adobe's colour generator](https://color.adobe.com/explore) and searched for colour schemes based on the search term "Dubai". I found a colour scheme generated from a picture of the Dubai skyline at sunset with the desert in the foreground. From there, I chose the chocolate brown colour (Hex code: #73351F) to be the main colour.

I then used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to generate a colour scheme using the chocolate brown colour as the main colour. I decided upon this colour scheme which includes a lighter brown colour, a beige-cream colour and a blue as an accent colour.

To make sure these colours would be accessible to those who are visually impaired, I used [EightShapes' contrast grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/). The brown and beige colours can be used interchangeable along with white and black. However the blue accent colour (Hex code #00B2FF) only passes the contrast test with Black, so for this I have decided to use it only as an accent colour with buttons for example. ![Screenshot 2023-12-21 at 17 08 12](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/a1dd0f70-6598-4e4b-a9d3-aa249a886a0e)
