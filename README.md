<h1 id="page-top"> Legacy of Dubai: From Sands to Skyscrapers</h1>

## Introduction 

**Legacy of Dubai** is a website which goes into depth on the history of Dubai, from its beginnings as a desert Emirate into the luxurious, glamorous Emirate we know of today. The site is targetted towards people who want to learn more about Dubai and its rich history, especially those who are planning to visit Dubai or have already done so. **Legacy of Dubai** will be a useful site for tourists and non-tourists alike who take great interest in Middle Eastern history and culture.

## Design

### Typography

The header fonts have been set to **Montserrat** for a clean but slightly regal look. As it is a part of the sans serif family, it also allows accessibility for those with visual impairments. I used [fontjoy.com](fontjoy.com) to help pair a similar font to **Montserrat** to be used for the body of the text. The font that was generated was **Mukta**, keeping the theme cohesive, but allowing the pages to still be clean and readable.

### Colour Scheme

I wanted the colour scheme of the website to reflect the colours of the desert, as it is what I most commonly associate Dubai and the Middle East with. I first went onto use [Adobe's colour generator](https://color.adobe.com/explore) and searched for colour schemes based on the search term "Dubai". I found a colour scheme generated from a picture of the Dubai skyline at sunset with the desert in the foreground. From there, I chose the chocolate brown colour (Hex code: #73351F) to be the main colour.
![Screenshot 2023-12-21 at 16 49 16](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/d1bcd012-fdfe-4c1b-8507-94d6a0c7449b)

I then used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to generate a colour scheme using the chocolate brown colour as the main colour. I decided upon this colour scheme which includes a lighter brown colour, a beige-cream colour and a blue as an accent colour.
![Screenshot 2023-12-21 at 17 06 37](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/c274b7a4-580a-4fc4-8c90-871ccd10eada)

To make sure these colours would be accessible to those who are visually impaired, I used [EightShapes' contrast grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/). The brown and beige colours can be used interchangeable along with white and black. However the blue accent colour (Hex code #00B2FF) only passes the contrast test with Black, so for this I have decided to use it only as an accent colour with buttons for example. ![Screenshot 2023-12-21 at 17 13 08](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/53c65327-1b95-4206-a170-ce81ec4ba1a2)
The lighter brown colour (Hex code #AB654C) however does not pass with the other colours, and only recieves a AA pass when used with black. So I decided to not use this colour throughout my project.

### Wireframes

Initially I had made simple wireframe structures using **Balsamiq** for the home page on dekstop and mobile. I have since made some slight changes to the deployed website, mainly with the hero cover text and its positioning.

## Features

### Common Features

#### Navigation Bar

The first common feature of the website is the navigation bar. The navigation bar keeps the same style across all pages of the website (including the hidden pages) and keeps the logo on the left hand side.

On mobile phones, a menu icon is placed on the right hand side, and when clicked upon, a drop down menu appears underneath with the links showing in a column.

![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 18 31 57](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/bd815ff0-2c5b-42bb-8ab2-09bf942f0217)
![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 18 32 10](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/72fcada9-6231-46d5-a3b6-ed53140918a5)


On larger screens, the menu icon is gotten rid of in favour of having the links display in a row on the right hand side of the header.

![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 18 33 02](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/a945b780-a7b3-4035-a484-71ff5f26f68f)

The **Contact Us** link has been styled as a button on all screen sizes to indicate that this page does not follow the flow of the main content.

The navigation links are underlined as a visual clue to the user to highlight which page they are currently on.

![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 18 33 34](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/a6df60dd-0769-47c0-9ecc-01cb479e9c7b)

On laptop screens and larger, the **Page 1 and Page 2** links show an underline when theyuser hovers on them to indicate that they are cliackable. For the **Contact Us** button, the button changes into a blue colour with black text when hovered upon, again to show it is clickable, but also that it will lead to a page which is not part of the main content.

![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 18 35 07](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/67170b4e-21e9-424a-b01c-e21fdd7e1fd9)

#### Footer

The footer, like the navigation bar, also remains the same on all pages of the website. The footer includes 3 links to social networking sites: Facebook, Twitter/X and Instagram. Underneath the links there is copyright text.

![Screenshot 2023-12-25 at 18 49 58](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/1e1d4dd0-528c-42d2-9692-6d5e67ecea33)

On laptop and desktop screens, hovering over the links will produce an underline. Again, this is to indicate that the links are clickable.

![Screenshot 2023-12-25 at 18 53 49](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/bef8b79c-1411-4eed-aa9e-7d019f4a1c94)

## Other Features

### Home Page

The home page has a hero image of the Burj Khalifa at night time, one  of Dubai's most famous landmarks and also the tallest building in the world. I wanted to use this as the main hero image due to its recognisability and association with Dubai.

![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 18 36 28](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/384b9837-9f02-4f06-ab1f-dfdfbab803c0)

There is also overlay text which reinforces the website's name, and also provides a tagline of *"From Sands to Skyscrapers"*. The same tagline is in the website's title, so that it shows in the tab on the web browser. This tagline summarises the history of Dubai but adds some drama. <!--reword this please).--> The overlay text is centered on mobile phones, but on larger screens it is placed in the top-right corner as to not cover the background image of the Burj Khalifa.

![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 18 37 23](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/7beeeb3a-c3eb-418f-a744-a7c50e7d63cd)

Introduction text underneath the hero image helps give a clear understanding about what the site is about.

![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 18 45 18](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/67b6580c-6e12-40d3-8a43-b5300fa95144)

### Origins Page 

The origins page starts off the first half of the journey on the website through Dubai's history. It provides a detailed account of Dubai's history from it's earliest record until the discovery of oil in 1966. The page is split into sections which group specific time periods together.

![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 21 37 39](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/919e8195-8f65-46a9-bfe5-f89c0f83587a)

### Modern Day Page

The modern day page goes into depth about the development of Dubai after the discovery of oil, right until modern day. A video is embedded which is a 5 minute visual summary of the development of Dubai, dating when all the landmarks and areas of Dubai were built and developed.

![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 21 38 24](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/6198df35-445c-4a53-8449-02e375feff04)

### Contact Form Page

The contact form page has a different hero image this time, one of the Burj al Arab, another famous landmark of Dubai.

The contact form has been placed over the image but given some transparency to allow the picture of the Burj al Arab to still show through behind.

The contact form allows the user to send any questions/queries they might have, or simply just some feedback to improve the site. The contact form requires both a First and Last name, an e-mail address and a message. There is an optional radio button section which allows the user to enter whether they have visited Dubai before or not.

![Screenshot 2023-12-25 at 20 29 11](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/3504b4df-8913-41bf-8f9c-170993243706)

### Hidden Pages

There are two hidden pages on the website. The first is a thank you page, which loads after submitting the form.

![Screenshot 2024-01-02 at 11 58 35](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/70a78248-c0b0-4b8a-9bda-a444c7f0cbba)

The second page is a 404 page. I have styled my own 404 page rather than rely on the one provided by GitHub. This page will load if an incorrect address is typed into the address bar.

![Screenshot 2024-01-02 at 12 00 46](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/72593752-a9af-4019-b0a6-6d30f9a3e5b4)

### Future Features

- In the future, I would like to add another page which discusses Dubai's future goals and projects, as they are constantly evolving and changing. For example, a new high-speed train is being developed, which will run between all 7 emirates and be the first to do so.
- Another feature would be to implement a gallery page with photos of the famous landmarks in Dubai, or before/now pictures.

## Testing

### Validation of Code

Before checking the validation of the code on the deployed website, I checked the validity of the HTML and CSS frommy workspace using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for any errors. Initially, for the **Contact Us** button, my html code was written so that the **button** element was wrapped in an anchor tag, and styling the button itself using css. When I ran the code through the validator, this showed up as an error saying that the button element must not be a descendant of the anchor tag. I found a blogpost on [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/answers/how-do-i-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link/) that explains that this is because of an accessibility issue. Instead, I left it as a link and used CSS to style it as a button, using the suggestion from the blogpost. When running through the vaiidator, this did not bring up any errors.

Using the W3C HTML validatr, no errors were shown after validating each page on the website.
- [index.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmariam138.github.io%2Flegacy-of-dubai%2F)
- [origins.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmariam138.github.io%2Flegacy-of-dubai%2Forigins.html)
- [modern-day.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmariam138.github.io%2Flegacy-of-dubai%2Fmodern-day.html)
- [contact-form.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmariam138.github.io%2Flegacy-of-dubai%2Fcontact-form.html)
- [thank-you.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmariam138.github.io%2Flegacy-of-dubai%2Fthank-you.html)
- [404.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmariam138.github.io%2Flegacy-of-dubai%2F404.html)

Using the Jigsaw CSS validator, no errors were found in the CSS for the website.

![Screenshot 2024-01-05 at 17 26 59](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/7476a079-b5b4-4aba-bef3-d3f7de08adc4)

### Accessibility Testing

The accesibility of the website was validated using [Wave](wave.webaim.org). One error came up on the deployed site initially,where my message input on the contact form had an empty label. I entered in a label and used the sr-only class in my CSS to visually hide the label but still be present for screenreaders. Upon checking again, no error was seen on the contact form page. No other errors were shown on the other pages of the website.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse on Chrome's DevTools to test the website's performance on both Mobile and Desktop.

- The initial report for mobile gave a performance score of 62 which was due to the size of the front page's hero image. After reducing the image size and optimising it for mobile, I ran the report again. No issues were raised after this change.
![Screenshot 2024-01-02 at 12 08 58](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/cc1bcad3-799e-4b9a-903a-705dd62bf59a)

- For the desktop, no issues were raised by the performance test.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing was done on several devices: 
- Desktop:
- Laptop: MacBook Air 13"
- Tablet: iPad Mini 3
- Phone: iPhone 13
- Android: Chrome DevTools

Testing was conducted on the following browsers:
- Google Chrome
- Safari

### Bug Fixes

1. Upon initial deployment onto github pages, none of the CSS styling appeared to be showing, despite showing on thge local server. When checking the code for the link to the CSS style sheet in the HTML index page, the file paths appeared to start with a forward slash (/), making them absolute file paths rather than relative file paths. Removing the forward slash fixed the problem, allowing the CSS  styling to show on the deployed webpage.

2. After styling the hero image for the home screen, I checked to see whether it was responsive for all screen sizes. Viewing the home page on my laptop screen showed there to be some whitespace on the right of the page, leading to a horizontal scroll bar. This would lead to a bad user experience.

    To fix this, I used the **overflow-x** property to hide the horizontal scroll bar. This helped to get ride of the white space on the screen.

3. When inserting images into the main content, I tried to use the picture tag so that I could use media queries to have different resolutions of the same picture show at different screen sizes. But when checking on both Dev tools and on the deployed website, this didn't seem to work, and would only show the smallest resolution image.

    ![Screenshot 2023-12-31 at 10 47 15](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/23dc6260-d745-47dc-b849-ed8d2093a7c2)

    I tried running the code through the W3C HTML validator to check for any errors, in which it didn't bring up any. Googling for an answer also came to no avail. I used the tutor service to see if they could help with my code as a final resort. The tutor checked my media queries using a different image which seemed to work, but would not work on the images I wanted to use. Unfortunately, the tutor could also not figure out the problem. So I had to resort back to using the img tag instead and using the media queries in my CSS stylesheet.

4. When embedding a youtube video into the post-oil.html page, the youtube video would not load and a broken link would show.
   ![Screenshot 2023-12-31 at 12 51 27](https://github.com/mariam138/legacy-of-dubai/assets/150139337/99c42be7-b44a-4000-bafc-20ff96d67471)
   Instead of copying the url directly into the src attribute tag for the iframe, I copied and pasted the embed tag that youtube itself gives for the video. There may also have been a missing > at the end of my iframe tag which is why the video may not have worked. This solved the issue and the youtube video was able to load.

5. On larger screens, the background picture of the Burj Al Arab on the contact form page would show a gap underneath, rather than covering the full screen. This turned out to be because I had set the height on the image to 700px. To fix this, I changed the height to 100vh instead, and also added the property background-attachment and made it fixed. This is so that when scrolling on larger screens, if the height of the image was less than the screen the gap would not show when scrolling.

6. For the contact form, I used a **textarea** element for the "Your message" part of the form. I set the width and height using the **cols** and **rows** attributes in the html tag. On larger screens, this was fine. But on smaller screens, such as on mobile screens, the text area would overflow over the actual contact form itself.  By setting the width of the text area to 100%, this allowed it to stay within the contact form divider at all screen sizes.
