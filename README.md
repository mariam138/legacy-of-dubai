# Legacy of Dubai: From Sands to Skyscrapers
## Introduction
**Legacy of Dubai** is a website which goes into depth on the history of Dubai, from its beginnings as a Dessert emirate into the luxurious, glamorous City we know of today. The site is targetted towards people who want to learn more about Dubai and its rich history, especially those who are planning to visit Dubai or have already done so. **Legacy of Dubai** will be a useful site for tourists and non-tourists alike who take great interest in Middle Eastern history and culture.

## Design
### Fonts

The header fonts have been set to **Montserrat** for a clean but slightly regal look. As it is a part of the sans serif family, it also allows accessibility for those with visual impairments. I used [fontjoy.com](fontjoy.com) to help pair a similar font to **Montserrat** to be used for the body of the text. The font that was generated was **Mukta**, keeping the theme cohesive, but allowing the pages to still be clean and readable.
